  "Return the object currently being built.
This is meant to be used inside `defclass' slot @initform arguments to make dependent arguments.

For this to work, an `initializeInstance @before' method should be defined and use `_\\@set_built_obj'
to define the object being built.

This is managed by default when using `@class'."
